⚙️ How It Works (Simple Explanation)
When you open the extension, it gets all the tabs you currently have open using Chrome’s Tabs API. These tabs are saved in a list and shown on the screen.
As you type in the search box, the list updates in real time by matching your input with tab titles and URLs.
You can click a tab or press Enter to open it. You can also use the arrow keys to move up and down the list. A close button lets you remove tabs you don’t need anymore.
